# CognoRise_NumberGuessing
This code is a Java program that implements a simple Number Guessing Game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. The program takes input from the user for each guess and provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses the correct number, the program congratulates them and displays the number of attempts it took. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the maximum attempts, the program reveals the correct number.
